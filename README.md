Chrome's Dino Automation
A very simple effort to automate Google'g dino game using Selenium with Python.

Google's Dino game is also known as the Chrome Dino is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score

It originally supposed to be built using image processing which leads it to be an intermediate machine learning project. But I made it using manipulating website's components and using some scraping from my side.

How it works:
It simply detects the dimensions of the obstacle and the dino.

As soon as the dino comes within the 50px area of the cactus instead of game over it jumps (which is a js feature to tap space bar dynamically).

How to run it:
To run this in your system:
1. Make sure to have python installed in your system along with selenium and chrome webdriver
2. After setting up webdriver you now be able to run it in your IDE or notepad.
3. clone the repository and run it in your system.
4. You now be able to see it running.
